version 4.1 (200x-yy-zz) Increased the default keepalive timeout to 30
	seconds. Made number of selector threads configurable, with a
	default value of the number of cpu cores.

version 4.0 (2009-05-03) Reworked nio layer so that rabbit uses multiple
	selector threads. Reworked logging to use java.util.logging and
	made it possible to use either rabbit.conf or the system property
	java.util.logging.config.file to specify the logging
	configuration. Fixed a problem where web connections could be put
	into the connection pools multiple times.
