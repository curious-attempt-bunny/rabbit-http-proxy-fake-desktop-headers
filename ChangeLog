version 4.2 (200x-yy-zz) Made it possible to specify what network
	interface rabbit should listen on and what type of inetaddress to
	use (ipv4 or ipv6). Made it possible to specify what network
	interface and network type rabbit should use for outgoing
	connections. Made access logging handle log setup failure without
	getting NullPointerException.

version 4.1 (2009-07-01) Increased the default keepalive timeout to 30
	seconds. Made number of selector threads configurable, with a
	default value of the number of cpu cores. Made selector status
	page easer to read by altering colors between selectors. Made
	WebConnectionResourceSource actually grow the download buffer when
	it has read full chunks a few times. Made ConnectionHandler use
	concurrent collections for better scalability. ConnectionHandler
	now removes all empty pools. Tried to fix a NPE in the selector
	code. Call Deflater.end to release native zip resources earlier.

version 4.0 (2009-05-03) Reworked nio layer so that rabbit uses multiple
	selector threads. Reworked logging to use java.util.logging and
	made it possible to use either rabbit.conf or the system property
	java.util.logging.config.file to specify the logging
	configuration. Fixed a problem where web connections could be put
	into the connection pools multiple times.
